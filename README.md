# Using A Data Service with REST API (basic demo, 'get' only)
This project contains the code for the end state of Week 12 of CSCI E31.

It's [hosted on stackblitz] (https://stackblitz.com/github/Harvard-DCE-CSCIE3/angular-basic-http-data-service?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts) but the code does not run there (as of Spring 2018) due to Stackblitz not being able to access non-https URLs (such as the D.O. url for the REST API).
