# Using A Data Service with REST API (basic demo, 'get' only)
This project contains the code for the end state of Week 12 of CSCI E31.

It's [hosted on Stackblitz] (https://stackblitz.com/github/Harvard-DCE-CSCIE3/angular-basic-http-data-service?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts).

Note that Stackblitz, as of Spring 2018, does not support Angular making requests over http - it's https only.  If you decide to use this (or your own Angular app) with your own REST API, you must host the REST API on a server that supports HTTPS. The instructions by Jason Lengstorf at  [How to Deploy a Node.js App to DigitalOcean with SSL](https://code.lengstorf.com/deploy-nodejs-ssl-digitalocean/) are a quick and easy way to get HTTPS configured on your Digital Ocean NodeJS server.
